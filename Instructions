Mandatory Part

-l

(The lowercase letter ``ell''.)  List in long format.  (See below.)  If the output is to a terminal, a total sum for all the file sizes is output on a line before the long listing.

-R *

Recursively list subdirectories encountered.

-a

Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).

-r

Reverse the order of the sort to get reverse lexicographical order or the oldest entries first (or largest files last, if combined with sort by size

-t

Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sorting the operands by lexicographical order.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- You do not have to deal with the multiple column format for the exit when
the option -l isnâ€™t in the arguments

- You are not required to deal with ACL and extended attributes.


Allowed Functions:

write
opendir (const char *filename);
	opens dir named by filename + returns pointer to dir, error = NULL, no access = errno
readdir (DIR *dirp);
	returns pointer to next dir entry. end of dir / error = NULL.
closedir (DIR *dirp);
	closes named dir + frees structure assoc w dirp pointer, return 0 on success, -1 on failure, errno = ERROR.
stat (const char *restrict path, struct stat *restrict buf);
	obtains info about file 
lstat (const char *restrict path, struct stat *restrict buf);
	like stat for symbolic links
getpwuid (uid_t uid);
	return a valid pointer to a passwd structure on sucess or NULL if entry not found/error.

getgrgrid
	
listxattr (const char *path, char *namebuf, size_t size, int options);
	retrieves a list of names of extended attributes associated with a given path
time (time_t *tloc);
	returns value of time in seconds since 0/0/0/0, Jan 1, 1970. also stored in tloc.	
ctime (const time_t *clock);
	adjusts the time value for the current time zone. returns ptr to fmt:
